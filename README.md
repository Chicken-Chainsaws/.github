# Chicken-Chainsaws Organization Templates

This repository contains organization-wide GitHub configurations and issue templates for all repositories in the Chicken-Chainsaws organization.

## Issue Templates

We have two sets of issue templates:

### Markdown Templates (Recommended for solo projects)
- `bug-report.md` - Report bugs and defects
- `chore.md` - Maintenance tasks and housekeeping  
- `enhancement.md` - Improve existing features
- `feature-request.md` - Request new features
- `requirement.md` - Document requirements and specifications

### Issue Forms (YAML-based, more structured)
- `bug-report-form.yml` - Structured bug reporting form
- `feature-request-form.yml` - Structured feature request form

## Usage

These templates are automatically available across all repositories in the Chicken-Chainsaws organization when creating new issues.

Individual repositories can override these organization-wide templates by creating their own `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory.

## Issue Types

- **Bug**: Report bugs and defects that need fixing
- **Chore**: Maintenance tasks, cleanup, and housekeeping work
- **Enhancement**: Improvements to existing features or functionality
