### Syncing Labels Across Repositories

To maintain consistency, labels are managed centrally in this `.github` repository and synced to all other repositories using our label sync script.

**To sync labels to all repositories:**

```bash
cd .github/scripts
./sync-labels.sh
```

**The sync process:**
1. Uses this `.github` repository as the source of truth for labels
2. Completely replaces labels in all other organization repositories
3. Ensures perfect consistency across all repos

**When to run the sync:**
- After adding, editing, or removing labels in this repository
- When onboarding new repositories to the organization
- Periodically to ensure consistency

## üìã Issue Templates

Issue templates are automatically available across all repositories in the organization when creating new issues.

### Available Templates
- **Bug Report** - Report bugs and defects using a structured form
- **Feature Request** - Request new features with detailed specifications
- **Enhancement** - Propose improvements to existing features
- **Requirement** - Document detailed requirements and specifications
- **Chore** - Maintenance tasks, cleanup, and technical debt

### Template Customization
Individual repositories can override these organization-wide templates by creating their own `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts

### `scripts/sync-labels.sh`
Synchronizes labels from this repository to all other repositories in the organization.

**Usage:**
```bash
cd .github/scripts
./sync-labels.sh
```

**Features:**
- Automatic detection of all organization repositories
- Complete label replacement (not merge) for consistency
- Progress reporting and error handling
- No user prompts - fully automated
